# Train-Time

Requirements
Created a train schedule application for the 59th Street & Columbus Circle Subway Station. It incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. It provides up-to-date information about various Subway train lines, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at this station.
